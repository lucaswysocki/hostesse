Project Name: hostesse

General Description: Hostesse is a web application designed to monitor the availability of hosts within a local network. It allows users to manage a list of monitored servers and view their status in real-time through an intuitive interface accessible via a web browser.

Functionalities:

1. Adding/Removing Hosts: Users can add or remove hosts (IP addresses or domain names) from the monitored list.
2. Status View: The application displays the current status of each host (online/offline) with real-time refresh capabilities.
3. Authorization: Optional user login to secure access to the management panel.
4. Configurable Check Interval: Ability to set the frequency of host pinging.
5. Event Logging: Recording of status changes and other significant events within the system.

Technologies:

Backend:
Python 3.8+
1. Flask – lightweight web framework.
2. SQLAlchemy – handling the SQLite database.
3. ping3 – for checking host availability.

Frontend:
1. HTML5, CSS3
2. Bootstrap 5 – for a responsive user interface.
3. Jinja2 – template engine for Flask.

Security:
Flask-Login – managing user sessions and authorization.

Project Assumptions:
1. Ease of Use: The application should be easy to install and operate without requiring complex configurations.
2. Lightweight: Low system resource consumption, capable of running on devices with limited computing power (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
3. Modularity: The code should be written to allow easy expansion with additional functionalities (e.g., integration with other monitoring systems).
4. Local Network Accessibility: The application is intended to operate within closed networks without the need to expose it externally.

System Requirements:
1. Operating System: Windows, Linux, or macOS.
2. Installed Python 3.8 or newer.
3. Access to a local network with the monitored hosts.
